# Credit Score Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict individual credit scores based on synthetic financial and demographic data. The goal is to demonstrate how supervised learning algorithms can be applied to assess creditworthiness.

## Contents
- `credit_score_generator.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full machine learning workflow â€” data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `synthetic_credit_data.csv`: A synthetic dataset used for building and testing the model.

## Getting Started
